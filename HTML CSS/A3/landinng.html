                <h1>CARDIO</h1>
              </div>
              <p> Practicing cardio on a regular basis is one of the aspects we take the most into account when we want to get back in shape. But why is this so important for our health?
                  Cardio training exercises are the ones that increase our heart rate the most, increase our resistance and improve our physical condition.

                <h1>WEIGHT BAR</h1>
              </div>
              <p>
                I believe that barbell movements should be a staple in everyone’s fitness journey regardless of preferred training style. The three core barbell movements I am specifically referring to are squat, bench, and deadlift. These three movements can provide the most bang for your buck in regards to exercise selection.

                <h1>PUSHUPS</h1>
              </div>
              <p>
                Traditional pushups are beneficial for building upper body strength. They work the triceps, pectoral muscles, and shoulders. When done with proper form, they can also strengthen the lower back and core by engaging (pulling in) the abdominal muscles.
                Pushups are a fast and effective exercise for building strength. They can be done from virtually anywhere and don’t require any equipment.

                <p>When choosing your gym you should check there is a number of the equipment you feel you will use more. If you are going to focus on free weight training (dumbbells etc) check they have multiple sets. On weight machines check they have setting from minimal weight to maximum weight to suit your capabilities. </p>
